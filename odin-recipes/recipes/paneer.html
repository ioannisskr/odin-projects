    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p class="paragraph-margin">
      This easy paneer recipe is great for vegetarians. You can add paneer to
      your favorite curry or dish. Homemade paneer is softer and lighter than
      the tofu-like consistency of paneer found in many Indian restaurants.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 gallon milk</li>
      <li>1 quart buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 cup canola oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="margin-top font-size">Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour milk into a large pot and bring to a boil over medium heat; watch
        carefully to prevent milk from boiling over. When milk begins to boil,
        pour buttermilk into the pot in a steady stream, stirring constantly.
        The milk will separate into curds and water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a colander with cheesecloth. Pour milk mixture through the
        cheesecloth, reserving some of the strained liquid. Let milk mixture sit
        in the colander until curds are settled and dripping stops, about 2
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer strained curds to a food processor. Process until smooth and
        mixture can be formed into a ball. Add some of the reserved liquid and
        process again if mixture is too dry. The consistency should resemble
        firm ricotta cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn cheese out onto a clean surface and knead until smooth. Form into a
        ball and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cook paneer, heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high
        heat. Cut paneer into bite-sized pieces. Fry in hot oil until very pale
        golden brown, about 1 minute. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
      </li>
    </ol>
